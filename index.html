          Normal Distribution</span> , also called the <span class="font-semibold">Gaussian Distribution</span> , is the
        most significant continuous <a href="#" class="text-[#8c69ff] hover:underline">probability distribution</a> .
        Sometimes it is also called a bell curve. A large number of random variables are either nearly or exactly
        represented by the normal distribution, in every physical science and economics. Furthermore, it can be used to
        approximate other probability distributions, therefore supporting the usage of the word ‘normal ‘as in about the
        one, mostly used.</p>

      <p class="text-[#444444] text-[16px] tracking-wide">The Normal Distribution is defined by the <a href="#"
          class="hover:underline text-[#8c69ff] ">probability density function</a>
        for a continuous random variable in a system. Let us say, f(x) is the probability density function and X is the
        random variable. Hence, it defines a function which is integrated between the range or interval (x to x + dx),
        giving the probability of random variable X, by considering the values between x and x+dx.</p>
      <p class="text-[#444444] my-4">f(x) ≥ 0 ∀ x ϵ (−∞,+∞)</p>

      <ul class="text-[14px] text-[#444444] pl-9">
        <li class="list-disc tracking-wide">x is the variable</li>
        <li class="list-disc tracking-wide">μ is the mean</li>

      </ul>
      <h3 class="text-[20px] text-[#444444] font-semibold my-3">Normal Distribution Curve</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">The <a href="#" class="text-[#8c69ff] hover:underline">random variables</a> following the normal
        distribution are those whose values can find any unknown value in a given range. For example, finding the height
        of the students in the school. Here, the distribution can consider any value, but it will be bounded in the
        range say, 0 to 6ft. This limitation is forced physically in our query.</p>
      <p class="text-[#444444] mb-4">Whereas, the normal distribution doesn’t even bother about the range. The range can
        also extend to –∞ to + ∞ and still we can find a smooth curve. These random variables are called Continuous
        Variables, and the Normal Distribution then provides here probability of the value lying in a particular range
        for a given experiment. Also, use the <a href="#" class="hover:underline text-[#8c69ff]">normal distribution
          calculator</a> to find the probability density function by just providing the mean and standard deviation
        value.</p>
      <h3 class="text-[24px] text-[#444444] mb-3">Normal Distribution Standard Deviation</h3>
      <p class="text-[#444444]">Generally, the normal distribution has any positive standard deviation. We know that the
        mean helps to determine the line of symmetry of a graph, whereas the standard deviation helps to know how far
        the data are spread out. If the standard deviation is smaller, the data are somewhat close to each other and the
        graph becomes narrower. If the standard deviation is larger, the data are dispersed more, and the graph becomes
        wider. The standard deviations are used to subdivide the area under the normal curve. Each subdivided section
        defines the percentage of data, which falls into the specific region of a graph.</p>
      <p class="text-[#444444] my-4">Using 1 standard deviation, the Empirical Rule states that,</p>
      <ul class="pl-10 text-[#444444] text-[14px] tracking-wide flex flex-col gap-2">
        <li class="list-disc">Approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean. (i.e.,
          Between Mean- one Standard Deviation and Mean + one standard deviation)</li>
        <li class="list-disc">Approximately 95% of the data falls within two standard deviations of the mean. (i.e.,
          Between Mean- two Standard Deviation and Mean + two standard deviations)</li>
        <li class="list-disc">Approximately 99.7% of the data fall within three standard deviations of the mean. (i.e.,
          Between Mean- three Standard Deviation and Mean + three standard deviations)</li>

        <li>In a normal distribution, the mean, median and mode are equal.(i.e., Mean = Median= Mode).</li>

        <li>The normally distributed curve should be symmetric at the centre.</li>
        <li>There should be exactly half of the values are to the right of the centre and exactly half of the values are to the left of the centre.</li>
        <li>The normal distribution should be defined by the mean and standard deviation.</li>
        <li>The normal distribution curve must have only one peak. (i.e., Unimodal)</li>

            What is a normal distribution in statistics?</h3>
            <p class="pl-9 mt-2">A probability function that specifies how the values of a variable are distributed is called the normal distribution. It is symmetric since most of the observations assemble around the central peak of the curve. The probabilities for values of the distribution are distant from the mean narrow off evenly in both directions.</p>

          <h3 class="font-semibold flex gap-4"> <span class="font-medium">Q4</span>
            What are the characteristics of a normal distribution?</h3>
            <p class="pl-9 mt-2">The essential characteristics of a normal distribution are:
              It is symmetric, unimodal (i.e., one mode), and asymptotic.
              The values of mean, median, and mode are all equal.
              A normal distribution is quite symmetrical about its center. That means the left side of the center of the peak is a mirror image of the right side. There is also only one peak (i.e., one mode) in a normal distribution.</p>

          <h3 class="font-semibold flex gap-4"> <span class="font-medium">Q5</span>
            How do you know if data is normally distributed?</h3>
            <p class="pl-9 mt-2">A histogram presents a useful graphical representation of the given data. When a histogram of distribution is superimposed with its normal curve, then the distribution is known as the normal distribution.</p>

            How do you use a normal distribution table?</h3>
            <p class="pl-9 mt-2">As we know, the label for rows contains the integer part and the first decimal place of z. In contrast, the title for columns comprises the second decimal place of z. The values within the table are the probabilities corresponding to the table type. Hence, to get the value of 0.56 from the z-table, identify the probability value corresponding to the 0.5 row and 0.06 column (=0.2123).</p>
